Excited to share a new project I've been working onâ€”a fitness app built with React Native and Context API ! This app allows users to follow workout routines, track their progress, and achieve fitness goals, all with a seamless and interactive interface.

 Key Features:
- Home Workout Dashboard: Displays workouts completed, calories burned, and minutes of activity.
- Exercise Tracker: Keeps track of each exercise set, including images, names, and reps.
- Completion Tracking: A visual progress indicator for completed exercises, motivating users to stay on track.
- Break Timer: Automatically triggers rest breaks between sets.
- Seamless Navigation: Navigate through the app smoothly, with easy access to workouts and exercise details.

ðŸ“± The UI leverages React Native components like `ScrollView`, `ImageBackground`, and custom `FitnessCards`. It's optimized for both iOS and Android!

 Tech Stack:
- React Native for cross-platform development
- Context API for global state management
- React Navigation for smooth user navigation
- Expo for easier development and faster prototyping

Building this app allowed me to dive deeper into state management and navigation workflows , while also focusing on delivering an intuitive user experience.

Next Steps:
- Add real-time workout data sync
- Introduce new workout categories and routines
- Incorporate push notifications for reminders
